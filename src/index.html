          to Portland, Oregon we're going to take you on an exciting journey through some unknown regions of
          your country. Leave the car at home and travel by bike starting in New England where it all began.
          You will pass through 12 beautiful states, covering a total of 3,600 miles, and accomplish
          3 monumental missions. Partying and taking a selfie with a famous rock star, donating $1
          to a billionaire to help eradicate polio in Africa, and even stopping by famous author
          Stephen King's house to say hi and asking him to sign your favorite book.

        <p class="place__paragraph">Still, as sparsely populated as it was in the 1600s, this
          is an extraordinary and highly underrated state full of
          rich history and majestic natural beauty. Maine is the
           main state you want to be sure not to miss. As your journey
          is going to be a long one, you had best be prepared for
          an arduous trek.
        </p>
        <p class="place__paragraph">Thankfully, not only is Maine home to
          the very first European settlers on US territory in the era of
           Vikings, but is also home to L.L. Bean, which is a great company
            to grab a super sturdy backpack from for your 3-month expedition.
        </p>
        <p class="place__paragraph">Average cost: $80-100.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="place__paragraph">There's no better place to lose yourself
          in nature than in springtime New Hampshire. As serene and beautiful
          as it was in the 1700s, this state is still much less traveled than
          its neighbors to the South. So enjoy it while it lasts.
        </p>
        <p class="place__paragraph">You won't be on your bike the whole time,
          so doesn't it make sense to pick up some extra footwear? Fortunately
          for you, the best outdoor shoe company in the history of the world
          proudly hails from this state. Cycle by the Timberland headquarters
          in Stratham, and pick up a pair of rugged, waterproof boots to keep
          your feet dry. Fitting for unpredictable weather you may be
          confronted by while passing through the Appalachians. These boots
          are also better than cycling shoes when pitching a tent.
        </p>
        <p class="place__paragraph">Average cost: $100-150.</p>

        <p class="place__paragraph">Not only famous for “The Big Apple,”
          the state of NY also has several other reasons for going down in history.
          Since the late 1800s Schenectady, “The City that Lights and Hauls the World,”
          has been home to the world-famous General Electric Company.
        </p>
        <p class="place__paragraph">This is where modern power generators were born as
          well as contemporary means of transmitting energy. So we figured this would be
          the perfect place to find a batteryless dynamo light for your bicycle to help
          you see through those dark lonely roads on your adventure. Such a light from
          GE will set you back about $10-20.

        <p class="place__paragraph">Erie, Pennsylvania, not to be confused with the word “eerie,”
          although it can be from time to time, is another town worth passing through for several
          different reasons. While it might be most famously known as the scene of the Gettysburg
          address delivered by Mr. Lincoln during the Civil war, Pennsylvania also has produced a
          rather decent-sized Amish community (eerie, huh?)
        </p>
        <p class="place__paragraph">The reason we've brought you here today, if you haven't already
           guessed, can be summed up by using one delicious word: chocolate. Hershey's is a
           Pennsylvania-based company. Most likely, one of the tastiest missions you'll ever
           embark on during this tour, try to find an Amish friend and enjoy a bar in the National
           Wildlife Refuge on your way to Erie and have an extra eerie time!
        </p>
        <p class="place__paragraph">The current cost of a Hershey's Chocolate bar: about 60¢.

        <p class="place__paragraph">From the college capital of Columbus to the clean coastline
          of Cleveland, Ohio is a truly hidden gem. Earthquakes are surprisingly common in this
          particular region of North America, over 200 of which have registered with a magnitude
          of 2 or higher since 1776. However, earthquakes aren't the only thing shaking this
          centrally located state. One of the country's largest and oldest roller coaster parks
          is waiting to ROCK your world in Sandusky, Ohio! This will presumably be one of the most
          thrilling quests you'll ever complete (provided you can stomach it). Take a much-deserved
          break to ride as many roller coasters as you can before continue your bike ride!
        </p>
        <p class="place__paragraph">The cost of a daily ticket: about $100.
